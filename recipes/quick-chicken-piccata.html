      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <p>
            Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to
            about 1/2-inch thick.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black
            pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in
            the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked
            through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine,
            until warmed though, about 30 seconds
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the
            bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half,
            about 2 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture;
            cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes.
            Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2
            minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
          </p>
